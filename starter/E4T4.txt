# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- Move the web server instance from the public subnet to a private subnet
- Add IAM policy to bucket to restrict read operation from a specific role.
- Create Network ACL rules to ban specific traffic
- Add a NAT gateway or a Web Proxy Layer to restrict egress traffic
- Set up web Application Firewalls to block attacks such as Cloud Front.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- Moving the endpoint for S3 to a private subnet would only prevent traffic coming from outside the VPC.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- No, There is no change to the encryption of the objects that existed in the bucket before default encryption was enabled. 

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- The new cloudformation will overwrite the changes done on the Security Groups, SSH password disabled, IAM role restrictions.
In order to apply the changes to the environment, the cloudformation template would need to be updated.
